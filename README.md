# Aashi's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University, a humble effort to make impactful visualizations.

# About me
Hello I am Aashi(she/her). I am currently doing my Masters in Management Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am a data enthusiast who loves drawing insights to tell meaningful stories from data. I use my creativity and business acumen in working in an agile and collaborative environment to invent solutions that will refine and transform complex business problems into simple analytical solutions

# What I hope to learn
”A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way.” - Mark Twain

I truly believe that the best way to learn something is to do it! I wish to learn how to keep my visualisations simple while being able to convey the whole and true story that the data reflects. In times when data is being called the new oil, this is an important skill to have.
