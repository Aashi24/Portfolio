## Debt-to-GDP ratio by Country - Column Bar Race

This visualization is an interactive bar chart that shows the changes from year to year with a play button. I kept the color light and consistent in the chart, and chose blue as it's a neutral color. So here it conveys that Japan debt-to-gdp ratio rose after 1999 and it maintained the top position till 2018

### Summary

I feel Grid of Lines chart is quite clean and subtle. I choose a warm color to give that effect as the chart could be overwhelming as there are 30 countries on a single chart\

I believe Column Bar Race chart conveys the message to the user very efficiently and with less effort, as it ranks the countries on each iteration(year) based on their debt-to-gdp ratio. hence this intercative play chart is the best way to represnt the data and convey the information ( how countries rank against each other) nicely
