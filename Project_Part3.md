# Part III: The final deliverable

**Intended Audience**

As mentioned in Part 2, the audience for my story are all Americans, young and old. The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about differences in Covid behavior between U.S and Australia and how this correlates to the number of cases and spread of virus in the two countries. Also allowing people to take insipiration from Australia to help convince them hifting their behavior in helping this fight against the Coronavirus pandemic


The final deliverable is a result of numerous iterations of wireframing based on peer feedback in part 1, part 2 and in-class discussions. Always kept in mind my intended audience (American population) when making updates based on the feedback
I realised through this process that what we perceive is not what others perceive something as.

Few changes incorporated in the final deliverable based on feedback:

**Develop a better narrative and an engaging story**

By first showming how my journey from Australia to US in Aug 2020 made me realize differences in people's reaction to Covid - 19
Then showing an engaging viz by drawing attention to the massive gap in covid cases in Australia and US over past year. The purpose to show is to attribute this difference to the social and behavioural sciences (based on my personal experience) rather than pharmaceutical interventions and Govt policies.
To strengthen my ground show some survey results of the people of two countries to show how Americans have been careless as compared to Australians
Finally came up with a new call to action -- Steps to Increase Community Enagagement of COVID - 19 response 


**Add more data viz to convey the story and call to action**

Utilized the Imperial College, London Covid Behavior Tracker data set to obtain more survey results and particularly relating to COVID vaccine as this topical in recent days
