# Part III: The final deliverable

The final deliverable is a result of numerous iterations of wireframing based on peer feedback in part 1, part 2 and in-class discussions. Always kept in mind my intended audience (American population) when making updates based on the feedback
I realised through this process that what we perceive is not what others perceive something as.

Few changed incorporated in the final deliverable based on feedback:

- Develop an better narrative and an engaging story 
By first showming how my journey from Australia to US in Aug 2020 made me realize differences in people's reaction to Covid - 19
Then showing an engaging viz by drawing attention to the massive gap in covid cases in Australia and US over past year. The purpose to show is to attribute this difference to the social and behavioural sciences (based on my personal experience) rather than pharmaceutical interventions and Govt policies.
To strengthen my ground show some survey results of the people of two countries to show how Americans have been careless as compared to Australians
Finally came up with a new call to action -- Steps to Increase Community Enagagement of COVID - 19 response
